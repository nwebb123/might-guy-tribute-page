# Inspirational Quote Generator
FreeCodeCamp (FCC) Tribute Page Challenge. Dedicated to Konoha's Noble Green Beast. Thanks to FCC and Gwen Faraday for the free Vue content.
 
 ### Purpose:
 Simple application that generages random inspirational quotes from the character Might Guy from Naruto. FCC's Front End Development Libraries certificate requires the developer to build a tribute page as well as a random quote generator, so I thought I would combine the two while also learning the basics of Vue.js, a popular front end framework.
 
 ### Technologies Used:
  - HTML5/CSS3/JS
  - Bootstrap 5 
  - Vue 2
  - Netlify/Github for hosting and CI/CD
